# Your project (inactive)

Introduce the project briefly; say what it is and what it does and why you might want to use or contribute to it.

## Getting started

Brief and specific installation instructions; how would someone knowledgeable get up and running with this code as quickly as possible?

## Documentation

More detailed documentation, depending on the needs of the project. Could include: requirements/dependencies, a use case with code samples, options for customization, and more. Needn’t be exhaustive, but should be helpful to someone trying to figure things out.

## Examples

Examples of the code in action; include a note to encourage users to add their own examples.

## Authors

List of Vox staff who authored the code.

## Contribution guidelines

This project is inactive and is not being maintained. Bugs, issues, and pull requests will not be readily addressed.

## Code of conduct

We aim to make our open source work a welcoming and harassment-free community for people of all races, gender and trans statuses, sexual orientations, physical abilities, physical appearances, and beliefs. We provide this code of conduct not because we anticipate bad behavior from our community—which, in our experience, is overwhelmingly kind and civil, but because we believe a clear code of conduct is a necessary part of building a respectful community space.

If you contribute to a Vox Media repository, you agree to:

* Be welcoming, friendly, and patient.
* Be considerate. Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. 
* Refrain from demeaning, discriminating, or harassing behavior or speech. Harassment includes but is not limited to: violent threats or language; use of sexual or discriminatory imagery, language, or jokes; unwelcome sexual attention; posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information (i.e., “doxing”); as well as advocating for or encouraging any of the above behavior.
* Take care of each other. If you notice any violations of this code of conduct, even if they seem inconsequential, send a note to [email address tbd].

If any contributor engages in harassing behavior, we may take any lawful action we deem appropriate, including warning the offender or blocking them from the repository. (If you feel you have been unfairly accused of violating this code of conduct, you should contact [email address tbd] with a concise description of your grievance.)
